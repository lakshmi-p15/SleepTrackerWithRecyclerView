# SleepQualityTracker app with RecyclerView

It is an improved version of my previous SleepQualityTrackerapp. This app display a list of results in a RecyclerView instead of a static ScrollView. Introduced design patterns to make it more efficient so it will be easier to maintain and test.

##This app demonstrates the following views and techniques:

* RecyclerView with Grid layout, adapter and ViewHolder
* Data binding, data adapters for displaying items & implementing click listeners for each the item
